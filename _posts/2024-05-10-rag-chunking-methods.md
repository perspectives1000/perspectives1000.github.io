### Chunking methods in indexing pipelines

Chunking is a crucial technique for handling large documents in indexing pipelines. It breaks down the documents into smaller, more manageable pieces for efficient processing and retrieval. Here's a breakdown of some common chunking methods:

**1. Naive Chunking:**

This is the simplest approach, where the document is split into chunks of a fixed size (e.g., by characters or sentences). It's easy to implement but might not always capture meaningful semantic units.

**2. Structural Chunkers:**

These methods leverage the document structure to define chunks. For instance, sections, paragraphs, headings, or even individual sentences can be used as chunks. This approach is more semantically aware than naive chunking.

**3. Summarization:**

Here, the document is automatically summarized into smaller snippets that encapsulate the key points. This can be particularly useful for very long documents where only the essential information needs to be indexed.

**4.  Extractive Chunking:**

This method identifies and extracts specific relevant passages from the document based on keywords or predefined rules. It's suitable for situations where you want to focus on specific aspects of the document.

**5. Multi-Modal Chunking:**

This approach is applicable for documents containing various media types like text, images, or audio. Each media type can be chunked using specific techniques and then combined for indexing.

Choosing the best chunking method depends on your specific needs and the nature of your documents.
