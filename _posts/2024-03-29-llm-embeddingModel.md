### Embedding Model vs LLM

Here's a breakdown of embedding models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand their key differences and how they relate:

**Embedding Model:**

- **Function:** Learns numerical representations (embeddings) of words or concepts. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and their context.
- **Think of it as:** A translator that converts words into a numerical code that computers can understand and manipulate.
- **Limited Functionality:** Primarily used for pre-processing text data for other models like LLMs.

**Large Language Model (LLM):**

- **Function:** Powerful AI models trained on massive amounts of text data. They can perform various tasks like text generation, translation, question answering, and writing different creative content formats.
- **Think of it as:** A skilled writer and communicator that leverages its knowledge to understand and respond to language in complex ways.
- **Relies on Embeddings:** LLMs often use pre-trained embedding models to convert input text into numerical representations that the model can process and understand the relationships between words.

**Here's an analogy:**

Imagine you're building a robot that understands and responds to human language.

- **Embedding model:** This is like creating a dictionary for the robot. The dictionary assigns unique numerical codes to each word, allowing the robot to recognize individual words.
- **LLM:** This is the robot itself. It uses the dictionary (embedding model) to understand the meaning of sentences and perform various tasks like having a conversation or writing a story.

**In essence, embedding models provide the foundation for LLMs. They create a common language for the LLM to understand the world through text data.**

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature | Embedding Model | Large Language Model (LLM) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function | Learns numerical representations of words/concepts | Performs complex language tasks (generation, translation, etc.) |
| Analogy | Dictionary translating words to codes | Robot using the dictionary to understand language |
| Capability | Limited - Pre-processing for other models | Powerful - Various language tasks |
| Dependence on Embeddings | N/A | Often relies on pre-trained embeddings |

### Embedding models - examples

Here's a list of embedding models and LLMs that can also function as embedding models:

1. **Word2Vec (Google)**: Distributed word vectors learned from large corpora.
2. **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**: Pre-trained word vectors trained on global word-word co-occurrence statistics.   (Stanford NLP group)
3. **FastText (Facebook)**: Word embeddings with subword information, useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words.
4. **GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)**: Capable of generating embeddings for words or phrases. (OpenAI)
5. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Fine-tuned BERT models can produce contextualized word embeddings.   (Google)
6. **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**: Fine-tuned T5 models can be used to generate embeddings for words or phrases.

These models are not only capable of generating embeddings for words or phrases but also excel in capturing semantic and syntactic information from text data.
