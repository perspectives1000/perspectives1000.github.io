### **Opinionated Clouds: Cloud with a Preference**

Unlike a traditional buffet-style cloud platform offering various options, an **opinionated cloud service prescribes a specific approach to application development and deployment within its environment.**  Imagine a pre-configured kitchen in a restaurant – optimized for a particular cuisine with designated tools and ingredients.

**Key features of Opinionated Clouds:**

- **Predefined Practices:** An opinionated cloud comes with a pre-selected toolbox. This includes pre-configured development environments, specific programming languages or frameworks, and deployment methodologies.
- **Reduced Complexity:** By offering a pre-defined approach, these clouds aim to simplify the development and deployment process. They handle configuration details, allowing developers to focus on core functionalities.
- **Efficiency Boost:** The prescribed practices are designed to streamline workflows, potentially leading to faster development cycles and lower costs.

**Trade-offs to Consider:**

- **Limited Flexibility:** While reducing complexity, opinionated clouds can restrict flexibility. If your needs fall outside their approach, customizing the environment or using alternative tools might be difficult.

**Examples of Opinionated Clouds:**

- **Google App Engine:** Encourages Python development and offers a pre-defined way to structure and deploy web applications.
- **AWS Lambda:** Promotes serverless computing, where code is triggered by events without managing servers.
- Azure functions, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Vercel

**Examples in Generative AI world:**

- Databricks
- Anyscale
- Mosaic
- Modal
- Runpod etc..
