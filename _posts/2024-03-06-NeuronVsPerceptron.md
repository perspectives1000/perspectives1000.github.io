Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature | Neuron | Perceptron |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inspiration | Biological neuron | Simplified model of a neuron |
| Structure | Dendrites, cell body, axon | Takes multiple inputs |
| Function | Weighted sum, activation function | Weighted sum, threshold activation function |
| Activation Function | Various non-linear functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) | Step function (binary output) |
| Capabilities | Learns complex patterns | Limited to linearly separable patterns |
| Applications | Building block of neural networks | Historical reference, basic building block sometimes |


- Neurons are more versatile and powerful due to their non-linear activation functions.
- Perceptrons are a stepping stone in the history of neural networks, but their limitations make them less useful in modern applications.
