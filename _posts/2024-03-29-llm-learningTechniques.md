### In context Learning

In context learning (ICL) is a technique for large language models (LLMs) to learn new tasks without extensive training. Here's the gist:

- You provide the LLM with a few examples and instructions in plain language.
- The LLM then uses its knowledge to complete similar tasks based on those examples.

Imagine you're teaching a child a new game. Instead of explaining all the rules, you show them how to play a few rounds. ICL is similar - the LLM learns by watching the "game" being played.

### Few-shot prompting ( in context learning)

Few-shot prompting is like **training a model on the fly**. You give a large language model (LLM) a few examples of what you want it to do, and it uses those examples to understand the task better. It's like showing someone a couple of times how to do something before asking them to do it themselves.

**Example:**

A **[prompt](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prompt)** that contains more than one (a "few") example demonstrating how the **[large language model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#large-language-model)** should respond. For example, the following lengthy prompt contains two examples showing a large language model how to answer a query.

| Parts of one prompt | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| What is the official currency of the specified country? | The question you want the LLM to answer. |
| France: EUR | One example. |
| United Kingdom: GBP | Another example. |
| India: | The actual query. |

Few-shot prompting generally produces more desirable results than **[zero-shot prompting](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#zero-shot-prompting)** and **[one-shot prompting](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#one-shot-prompting)**. However, few-shot prompting requires a lengthier prompt.

### **Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning vs. In-context Learning**

| Feature | Pre-training | Fine-tuning | In-context Learning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Learn general language understanding from massive unlabeled data | Specialize pre-trained model for a specific task | Achieve task-specific performance using prompts and pre-trained model |
| Data | Large, unlabeled text corpus | Labeled data relevant to the target task | No additional data required (uses pre-trained model and prompt) |
| Process | Train the entire model on the unlabeled data | Train a smaller subset of the model on labeled data | Fine-tune the model's behavior through carefully crafted prompts |
| Flexibility | Not task-specific, can be applied to various NLP tasks | Limited to the task the fine-tuning data represents | Most flexible, can be adapted to various tasks on the fly |
| Expertise | Requires knowledge of pre-training techniques | Requires understanding of the target task and data | Requires understanding of the task and crafting effective prompts |
| Computational Cost | High (training on massive datasets) | Lower than pre-training, but higher than in-context learning | Lowest (no additional training needed) |
| Explainability | Can be difficult to understand how the model arrived at its output | More interpretable than pre-training due to task-specific data | Interpretability depends on the prompt |

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

The best approach depends on several factors:

- **Task complexity:** Simpler tasks might benefit from in-context learning, while complex tasks might require fine-tuning.
- **Data availability:** Pre-training requires a lot of data, fine-tuning needs labeled data, and in-context learning requires no additional data.
- **Computational resources:** Pre-training is computationally expensive, fine-tuning is less so, and in-context learning is the most efficient.

**In essence:**

- **Pre-training** lays the foundation with general language understanding.
- **Fine-tuning** specializes that knowledge for a specific task.
- **In-context learning** leverages pre-trained knowledge through prompts to perform various tasks without additional training.

These approaches can be complementary. A model might be pre-trained, then fine-tuned for a specific task, and finally use in-context learning for further adjustments within that task based on specific prompts.
