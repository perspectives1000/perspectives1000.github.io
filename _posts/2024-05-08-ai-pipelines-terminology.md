## RAG pipeline terminology

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines involve several key components and terminologies. Here are some common terms and brief descriptions:

- **Retrieval:** The process of finding relevant information from a large corpus of documents based on the user's query.
- **Generation:** The process of creating new content using the retrieved information and a language model.
- **Contextualization:** Incorporating the retrieved context into the input for the language model to improve its understanding and response quality.
- **Vectorization:** Converting text into numerical representations (vectors) to make them suitable for comparison and similarity calculations.
- **Chunking:** Splitting text into smaller segments for efficient processing and retrieval.
- **Indexing:** Storing the vectorized chunks of text in a searchable data structure to enable fast retrieval based on similarity.
- **Inference:** Generating new content using the language model, taking into account the retrieved context.
- **Re-ranking:** Re-ordering the retrieved context to prioritize more relevant or useful information.
- **Fine-tuning:** Adjusting the parameters of the language model based on a specific task or domain to improve its performance.

These terms represent essential steps and techniques in RAG pipelines, enabling AI systems to generate more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate content.

## Indexing pipeline terminology

Indexing pipeline involves several key terms and concepts. Here's a list of common terminology with short descriptions:

- **Indexing:** The process of organizing and storing data in a structured format to facilitate fast and efficient search and retrieval.
- **Corpus:** A large collection of texts, documents, or data that serves as the source for indexing and retrieval.
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, for further processing.
- **Normalization:** Standardizing text by converting all characters to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase), removing stop words, and applying other text preprocessing techniques.
- **Vectorization:** Transforming text into numerical representations (vectors) to enable similarity calculations and comparison.
- **Embeddings:** **Dense vector representations** of words or documents that capture their semantic meaning and relationships with other words or documents.
- **Chunking:** Splitting text into smaller segments (chunks) for efficient processing and retrieval.
- **Similarity Search:** Finding documents or chunks that are similar to a given query or document based on their vector representations.
- **Inverted Index:** A data structure that maps words or tokens to their locations in the corpus, enabling efficient retrieval of documents containing specific terms.
- **Index Maintenance:** Updating and optimizing the index over time as new documents are added or removed from the corpus.

These terms represent essential components and processes in an indexing pipeline, allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of information from large collections of data.
