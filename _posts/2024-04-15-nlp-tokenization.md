### Tokenization - relevance

Tokenization is a fundamental step used across many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Here's a quick overview:

- **Preparing Text for Models:** Raw text is difficult for machines to understand. Tokenization breaks it down into smaller, manageable units like words, sentences, or characters. This allows NLP models to process and analyze the text more effectively.
- **Building a Vocabulary:** Tokens are used to **build the vocabulary**, which is a collection of unique words or units the model recognizes. This vocabulary is essential for tasks like embedding models where words are assigned numerical representations.
- **Understanding Context:** The choice of tokenizer can influence how a model captures context. For example, word tokenizers might miss nuances compared to subword tokenizers when dealing with compound words.

**Here are some common NLP applications where tokenization plays a vital role:**

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** LLMs like GPT-3 or Jurassic-1 Jumbo rely on tokenization to understand and respond to your prompts or questions.
- **Embedding Models:** Word2Vec or GloVe, which learn word representations, use tokenization to create the vocabulary and assign embeddings to each token.
- **Machine Translation:** Text is broken down into tokens (words or subwords) before being translated into another language, ensuring grammatically correct and meaningful translations.
- **Text Classification:** Tasks like sentiment analysis or spam detection rely on tokenization to identify relevant words or phrases that convey sentiment or indicate spam.
- **Question Answering:** Tokenization helps break down questions and passages for the model to search for relevant information and answer effectively.
- **Text Summarization:** The model uses tokenization to identify key points within a text by analyzing the tokens and their relationships.
- **Speech Recognition:** Spoken language is converted into text, and tokenization can be applied to segment it into words or phrases for further processing.
- **Information Retrieval:** Search engines use tokenization to process search queries and match them against indexed documents, finding relevant results based on token comparisons.

In essence, tokenization acts as a bridge between human language and machine understanding. It prepares text data for various NLP tasks, paving the way for effective communication and analysis.
