## Vectors vs Embeddings in NLP

In natural language processing (NLP), vectors and embeddings play crucial roles in representing words and documents in a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand. Here's a breakdown of both concepts:

1. **Vectors**:
    - In a general sense, a vector is a mathematical object that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction. In NLP, **vectors are used to represent words, phrases, or documents.**
    - Each dimension of a vector corresponds to a feature or aspect of the represented entity. For example, in a word vector, each dimension might represent the presence or absence of a particular word in a vocabulary.
    - Vectors can be created using various techniques, such as one-hot encoding, count-based methods like term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), or distributed representations like word embeddings.
2. **Embeddings**:
    - Embeddings are **dense, lower-dimensional representations of words or documents compared to the high-dimensional, sparse representations used in traditional vector space models.**
    - Word embeddings, in particular, capture semantic and syntactic similarities between words by placing similar words closer together in the embedding space.
    - Popular word embedding techniques include Word2Vec, GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), and fastText. These methods learn word representations by considering the context in which words appear in large text corpora.
    - Document embeddings are representations of entire documents in a continuous vector space. Techniques for generating document embeddings include averaging the word embeddings of words in the document, using techniques like Doc2Vec, or leveraging pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to encode entire documents.

Word embeddings have become a cornerstone in NLP tasks due to their ability to capture semantic relationships between words, which is vital for tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and named entity recognition. Similarly, document embeddings provide a way to represent documents in a meaningful vector space, enabling tasks like document classification, clustering, and information retrieval.

### Word embeddings vs Document embeddings

Word embeddings and document embeddings are both techniques used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent textual data in a numerical format, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of granularity:

1. **Word Embeddings**:
    - **Purpose**: Word embeddings are designed to represent individual words in a continuous vector space where similar words are placed closer together.
    - **Granularity**: They operate at the level of individual words.
    - **Representation**: Each word is mapped to a dense vector of fixed dimensionality, where the vector captures semantic and syntactic similarities between words.
    - **Training**: Word embeddings are typically trained using unsupervised learning techniques on large text corpora. Popular methods include Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText.
    - **Usage**: Word embeddings are commonly used as input features for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and text classification.
2. **Document Embeddings**:
    - **Purpose**: Document embeddings are designed to represent entire documents, paragraphs, or sentences in a continuous vector space.
    - **Granularity**: They operate at the level of entire documents or larger text segments.
    - **Representation**: Each document is mapped to a dense vector of fixed dimensionality, capturing the semantic content and contextual information of the entire text.
    - **Training**: Document embeddings can be generated using techniques like averaging the word embeddings of words in the document, models like Doc2Vec, or leveraging pre-trained models like BERT.
    - **Usage**: Document embeddings are useful for tasks such as document classification, clustering, information retrieval, and similarity analysis. They enable comparing and analyzing entire documents rather than just individual words.

In summary, while word embeddings focus on capturing semantic relationships between individual words, document embeddings aim to capture the semantic content and context of entire documents or text segments. Both types of embeddings are valuable tools in NLP, serving different purposes and catering to different levels of analysis.
