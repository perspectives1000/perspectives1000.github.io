## Keyword based search vs Semantic search

Semantic search and keyword-based search are two different approaches to information retrieval. While keyword-based search has been the traditional method used by search engines, semantic search is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to understand user intent and context. Here's a comparison between the two:

**Keyword-based Search:**

- This approach relies on **matching specific keywords or phrases** entered by users to the content in documents or web pages.
- Search engines using this method look for exact matches or close variations of the entered keywords.
- The search results are ranked based on factors like keyword density, relevance, and page importance.
- It is a straightforward and fast method, but its main limitation is that it cannot understand the meaning or context behind the search query.

**Semantic Search:**

- Semantic search focuses on **understanding the meaning and intent** behind the user's search query rather than simply matching keywords.
- It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to comprehend the contextual meaning of the search query.
- This approach allows search engines to provide more relevant and personalized search results by interpreting user intent, related concepts, and synonyms.
- While semantic search offers more accurate results, **it is computationally more complex and resource-intensive compared to keyword-based search.**

In conclusion, keyword-based search works well for simple queries and is easier to implement, but semantic search offers a more sophisticated and contextual understanding of user queries. As AI technology advances, semantic search is expected to play an increasingly important role in information retrieval systems.
