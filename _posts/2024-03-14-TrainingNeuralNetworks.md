### Training a Neural Network

Neural networks learn through a process called training, which involves iteratively adjusting the connections between neurons to improve their performance on a specific task. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** The first step is to prepare the training data. This data needs to be relevant to the task you want the network to perform and be formatted appropriately for the network architecture.
2. **Forward Pass:** During training, each data point is fed into the network's input layer. The information travels through the network layer by layer, with each neuron applying its activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. This process continues until the output layer produces a prediction.
3. **Error Calculation (Loss Function):** The network's prediction is compared to the actual target value (the correct answer) for that data point. The difference between the prediction and the target value is calculated using a loss function. This function quantifies how "wrong" the network's prediction was.
4. **Backpropagation:** Here's where the magic happens! The loss is propagated backward through the network layer by layer. This process calculates how much each neuron's weights and biases contributed to the overall error.
5. **Weight and Bias Update:** Based on the backpropagation calculations, the weights and biases of each neuron are adjusted in a way that minimizes the overall loss. This essentially pushes the network towards producing more accurate outputs for future data points.
6. **Iteration:** Steps 2-5 are repeated for multiple epochs (iterations over the entire training data set). With each epoch, the network's weights and biases are fine-tuned, gradually improving its accuracy on the training data.

**Key Points:**

- Training is an iterative process of feeding data forward, calculating errors, and adjusting weights backward.
- The loss function guides the training process by indicating how well the network is performing.
- Backpropagation is a crucial algorithm that allows the network to learn from its mistakes and improve its predictions.
- ***The goal of training is to find a set of weights and biases that minimizes the loss function and enables the network to generalize well on unseen data.***

**Imagine training a neural network to recognize cats in images:**

- You show the network many pictures of cats and non-cats.
- The network makes initial guesses about whether each picture is a cat.
- The errors between the guesses and the correct answers are calculated.
- The network adjusts its internal connections based on those errors, becoming better at distinguishing cats in future images.
